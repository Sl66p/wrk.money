# wrk.money
A coding project for a webcard site (originally for Sl66p (now wrk), orignally worked on by @permananttt, now taken over by @wrkdd), 
which may soon be turned into a multiprofile site.
(Kinda like guns.lol, but more private, or invite only.)

Visit the site @ https://wrk.money
Much love. -- wrk.
